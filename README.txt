README: Schedulers.cpp

Description: Program to simulate the following CPU scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF, RoundRobin, Lottery with the included testdata files

Run Instructions:
1) Compile and run program with supporting testdata file argument
 - Usage: g++ Schedulers.cpp && ./a.out testdata(1-4).txt

2) Program will read testdata file and run all CPU scheduling algorithms on the data and output formatted results of burst,wait,and turnaround times.
